                <h2>About Oscar</h2>
                <p>Hey, I'm Oscar. I work in IT and enjoy coding — I've always found it interesting to solve problems and build things with technology. Outside of work, I’m a big fan of video games and like to spend some downtime getting lost in different worlds. I also enjoy watching movies and TV shows, particularly psychological thrillers. There's something about the twists and suspense in those stories that I find really intriguing. I'm always trying to learn and grow, both in my career and in my hobbies.</p>
