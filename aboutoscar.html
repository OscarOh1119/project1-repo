                <h2>About Oscar</h2>
                <p>Hey, I'm Oscar. I am from New York and have a background in Computer Engineering. I have worked IT for about 2 years and collabed with my team members on this website as a means to start building something to get into the software space.
                <p>I love to watch different media. TV shows in particular are quite entertaining to me since there's so much good stuff out right now. I also like to play video games on my off time as well as trying out new things to get new skills. </p>
                <p>My personal preference when it comes to movies or TV shows are generally psychological thrillers but I also like to watch light-hearted shows as well. My picks in the previous page are meant to give you a range of options as I know my tastes may differ from yours but they are all shows I have enjoyed watching.  </p>
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to take a look at our website as well as reading this bio. Take care &#10024 &#11088 &#10024</p>
